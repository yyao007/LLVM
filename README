Install Clang and llvm

How to run:
We simply used "buildAndTest.sh".
You should have the same structure as CS201Profiling under  ~/Workspace/llvm/lib/Transforms/.
Then, cd to the above location. 
Finally, run "./buildAndTest.sh test" // notice test is the input file which is located under CS201Profiling/Support.
